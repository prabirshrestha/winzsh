The Windows port of zsh (the code in this directory) was originally 
written by Amol Deshpande in 1997. He maintained the project until 2001, 
at which time it was abandoned. In December 2009, Amol agreed to 
relicense his code to the 3-clause BSD license. Amol continues to 
maintain the Windows port of tcsh, which shares a large amount of common 
code with this port and is also licensed under the 3-clause BSD license. 

fork.c contains a memory allocator derived from tc.alloc.c from the tcsh 
distribution. When first incorporated in 1997, this code was under the 
4-clause BSD license, however as of tcsh release 6.12.00, tc.alloc.c and 
the rest of tcsh is under the 3-clause BSD license. 

GNU termcap (termcap.c, tparam.c & termcap.h) is licensed under the GNU 
GPL. 

The zsh source is covered under it's own copyrights, an OSI-Approved 
Open Source MIT-like license.
